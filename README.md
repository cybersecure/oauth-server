OAuth-Server
============

This is the oauth-server application which can used as the single sign-on provider within internal
class of applications.

It needs the applications to be registred with the server before they start redirecting the users to
be signed in from this server.

TODO
----
	* The authorise code generation
	* The access token logic
	* The redirection to the redirect uri
	* Write tests for the whole functionality : *VERY VERY IMPORTANT*
